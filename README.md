The [NFPA 704](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFPA_704) is a standard created by the [National Fire Protection Association](https://www.nfpa.org/). Colloquially, an implementation of this standard is known as a Fire Diamond or a **Hazard Diamond**.

<details>
  <summary>ðŸ”¥ Examples</summary>

## Propane (Câ‚ƒHâ‚ˆ)
Despite being an extremely flammable material, Propane is a common household fuel used for barbecues and portable stoves. Take note of the additional health hazard in blue.

## Variations
The example below shows a nondescript substance stored in a green barrel with a special hazard warning of <b>OXY</b>. Such a variation does not exist in the NFPA 704 standard; this demonstrates the regional or field-specific differences between hazard diamonds.

The [GHS identification system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globally_Harmonized_System_of_Classification_and_Labelling_of_Chemicals) is a widely-used standard containing various [easily recognizable pictograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHS_hazard_pictograms) to describe chemicals' hazards.

<details>
  <summary>ðŸ’  Examples</summary>

## Ethanol (Câ‚‚Hâ‚…OH)
Ethanol is a widespread yet potentially dangerous chemical. This gigantic vat of it warns that the substance is harmful, both in the long-term and from short exposure, and that it is flammable.

> While **Câ‚‚Hâ‚†O** is an acceptable molecular formula for Ethanol, the author prefers the "OH" version due to the attached hydroxyl group's separation from the rest of the structure.

## ðŸŽ® Gameplay

- You can craft a **Hazard Diamond** item with a dye corresponding to each quadrant of the diamond and an iron ingot in the center.
- Place the Hazard Diamond item down in the world like normal.
> **Note**: Similarly to item frames, Hazard Diamonds are **entities**. You can also place more than one in the same block-space.
- A placed Hazard Diamond is **editable**. Get close to the diamond and interact with it it to open the Edit screen.
    - Click on any of the four main quadrants to **scroll** through its display options. The colored quadrants range from 0-4 while the white quadrant has a few special symbols to choose from.
    - The GHS pictograms are displayed below the main diamond. Click on a pictogram to **toggle** it.
> **Note**: You'll know if the diamond was edited successfully when the hammering sound effect plays.
- When you're done editing a Hazard Diamond, sneak-interact on the entity while holding a honeycomb to **wax** it.
    - Interacting with the entity at this point will bring up the same screen in an **immutable** state.
- If you have [WTHIT](https://modrinth.com/mod/wthit) installed, you can also view the Hazard Data in the tooltip.

## ðŸ“š Library

*Hazard Diamond* is primary a library mod. It allows users to create and display Hazard Data to players with or without code. Exclusively within the API, however, is the ability to open mutable screens on the clientâ€”much like the placeable entityâ€”and listen to when edits are submitted.

[Make sure to read the wiki](https://github.com/acikek/hazard-diamond/wiki) for information on how to set up and use the various development features provided by the mod.
